                <p> may seem like a difficult task it's something that </p>
                <p>I've grown to love. There's a certain catharsis that</p>
                <p>comes with putting my feelings and experiences </p>
                <p>into words, and it helps me process and understand  </p>
                <p>my emotions better. It's not always easy,but I find  </p>
                <p>that it's an important part of my healing process.</p>

				<h1 id="title">"How do I see the world?"</h1>
                <p></p><br>
				<p>
                My perspective of the world is that it is inhabited by individuals with shattered souls,
                whose sole purpose is to seek solace at the end of each day, only to push it away during the night.
                They crave solitude in their rooms and fear revealing their wounds to anyone. On the rare occasion that they do, 
                it haunts them for eternity. They seek healing from others, but in doing so, they only end up with deeper wounds.
                It's been a year, but they don't cry because of the physical pain, it's the trust they gave to that person that 
                causes their tears. They cannot forgive themselves for making the same mistake of trusting someone after years of 
                teaching themselves not to. Some are even content with their broken souls and don't desire to be mended, unable to
                 bear the pain of another heartbreak. The world is full of shattered people who have lost the ability to trust anyone.

				<h1 id="title">"March Madness"</h1>
                <p></p><br>
				<p>
                    Throughout the entirety of March, I have been struggling immensely. My physical health is not at its best, and my mental state is very unstable.
                     I don't feel like my usual self, and even the smallest tasks feel incredibly difficult. 
                     I've experienced a series of unfortunate events and unexpected moments that have left me feeling lost and unsure about the direction of my life. 
                     I'm struggling to figure out who I should be dedicating my love and attention to at this stage in my life. 
                     Each day, I wake up with the hope that it will be better than the last, but unfortunately, 
                     I find myself experiencing the same or even worse pain than the day before.
                     Recently, I reached a breaking point like I have never experienced before.
                     I have come to the realization that during difficult times, it's not realistic to expect others to check in on you and ask about your well-being.
                     Everyone is dealing with their own struggles and challenges, and you ultimately have to face your struggles alone.
                     Each day feels like a battle, and I'm desperately hoping that this year will have a happy ending for me.

                   <p> I am beauty, but blind to my sadness </p>
                   <p> So I lie down bleeding into my madness</p>
                   <p>I was handed a sunrise, but learned young it dies at night</p>
                   <p>I’m older in my bones, the sunset's darkness light </p>
                   <p> Silence hears the snowflakes fall, my dreams in quiet sleep</p>
                   <p>Reality speaks too loud, echoes lost in darkness deep </p>
                   <p> I leave the door open, an illusion of possibilities</p>
                   <p>I look to learn of beauty in all its subtleties.</p>

				<p>
                Since I started taking Ashwagandha, most days have been the same. 
                There are no surprises, no excitement. I often find myself feeling uncontent, lacking excitement or the longing for joy,
                 and not feeling eager as everything is the same. 
                I forget to look around me, and I don't see the excitement. Instead, I see the paths which I have already walked, 
                and I see my own imprints. These imprints form the path, which gets deeper and deeper until the only thing 
                surrounding me are the walls of my own creation. My emotions are slowly turning off and shutting down. 
                I'm not sure if taking this supplement is good for my health, but all I know is that I really love how it works. 
                It really helps my heart not to feel anything in this painful world.
